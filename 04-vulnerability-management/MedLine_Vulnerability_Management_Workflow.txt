MEDLINE URGENT CARE CLINIC
===========================================================
VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (VMW)
===========================================================

Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-11-24
Author: I. Nashif

This document describes how MedLine Urgent Care identifies, analyzes,
prioritizes, remediates, verifies, reports on, and continuously improves
the management of security vulnerabilities across all systems, with special
focus on HIPAA, PHI protection, and clinical operations.

-----------------------------------------------------------
1. PURPOSE
-----------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of the Vulnerability Management Workflow is to ensure that
MedLine Urgent Care identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and corrects
security vulnerabilities in a timely manner, fully aligned with HIPAA
requirements and leading industry standards. This workflow is designed to
reduce organizational risk, safeguard patient privacy, maintain the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI, and ensure reliable
and secure clinical operations.

-----------------------------------------------------------
2. SCOPE
-----------------------------------------------------------
This Vulnerability Management Workflow applies to all MedLine Urgent Care
systems, assets, environments, personnel, and third parties involved in the
identification, assessment, remediation, or management of security
vulnerabilities. This includes, but is not limited to:

- On-premise systems and servers
- Cloud platforms and hosted services
- Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems and clinical applications
- Workstations, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices
- Network infrastructure (routers, switches, firewalls, wireless networks)
- Medical and IoT devices used in clinical operations
- Data storage systems (local, cloud, hybrid)
- Vendor-managed platforms with MedLine access or PHI handling
- All workforce members involved in vulnerability identification,
  remediation, or oversight

No system, user, vendor, or environment that stores, processes, or
transmits MedLine data is exempt from this workflow.

-----------------------------------------------------------
3. DEFINITIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------
Asset
  Any system, device, application, database, network component, medical
  device, or cloud resource owned, operated, or used by MedLine that
  stores, processes, or transmits data.

Asset Owner
  The individual or department responsible for the operation, maintenance,
  and security posture of a specific asset.

Vulnerability
  A flaw, weakness, misconfiguration, or absence of a required control in a
  system that could be exploited by a threat actor to compromise
  confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

Threat
  Any circumstance, event, or actor with the potential to exploit a
  vulnerability and cause harm to MedLine’s operations, PHI, or systems.

Exploit
  A method, tool, or technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability to
  gain unauthorized access, cause damage, or impact operations.

CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
  An industry-standard system (v3.1) for evaluating the severity of
  vulnerabilities based on exploitability, impact, and environmental
  factors; scores range from 0.0 (none) to 10.0 (critical).

Severity Rating
  A classification (Low, Medium, High, Critical) derived from CVSS scores
  and adjusted for business context, asset criticality, and PHI exposure.

Risk Score
  A combined measure of severity, asset criticality, exploitability,
  likelihood, and potential impact used to prioritize remediation.

Remediation
  A permanent fix for a vulnerability, such as patching, code correction,
  configuration hardening, or system upgrade.

Mitigation
  A temporary or compensating measure (firewall block, segmentation,
  service disablement) applied when immediate remediation is not possible.

Compensating Control
  A security measure that reduces risk when the primary control cannot be
  implemented; must provide equal or greater protection.

Verification / Validation
  The process of confirming that a vulnerability has been successfully
  remediated or mitigated (e.g., re-scanning, log review, functional
  testing).

Exception / Risk Acceptance
  A formal approval to delay or forgo remediation when business constraints
  prevent timely resolution. Requires documented risk acceptance and
  compensating controls.

Patch Management
  The process of applying vendor-released updates, fixes, or security
  patches to systems and applications.

Exposure Window
  The period during which a system remains vulnerable before remediation
  occurs.

Emergency Vulnerability
  A vulnerability with active exploitation, weaponized exploit code, or
  severe PHI impact requiring immediate action outside of normal cycles.

Zero-Day Vulnerability
  A vulnerability publicly exposed with no vendor patch available; often
  high-risk and requires compensating controls.

HIPAA Security Rule
  Regulatory standard requiring administrative, physical, and technical
  safeguards for PHI, including ongoing vulnerability management
  (§164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A)).

Authorized Scanning Tool
  Any approved solution used to detect vulnerabilities (e.g., Nessus,
  Qualys, OpenVAS, Azure Security Center).

PHI (Protected Health Information)
  Individually identifiable health information protected under HIPAA,
  requiring the highest level of security and priority during remediation.

identification. Vulnerabilities may be discovered through automated tools,
vendor advisories, security research, manual reviews, incident
investigations, and threat intelligence.

1. Automated Vulnerability Scanning
  - Network scanning (internal and external)
  - Host/endpoint scanning for OS and software flaws

  - Daily cloud posture scans
  - Quarterly deep authenticated scans
  - Continuous IoT/medical device monitoring
  - Immediate follow-up scanning after critical advisories

-----------------------------------------------------------
7. VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS & PRIORITIZATION
-----------------------------------------------------------
MedLine uses a multi-factor, risk-driven prioritization model that
incorporates CVSS severity, exploitability, PHI sensitivity, clinical
impact, business context, regulatory obligations, and threat intelligence.

1. CVSS Base Score
  - Critical: 9.0–10.0
  - High: 7.0–8.9
  - Medium: 4.0–6.9
  - Low: 0.1–3.9

2. Exploitability & Threat Intelligence
  - CISA KEV listing
  - Confirmed active exploitation in the wild
  - Public exploit code (e.g., Metasploit, GitHub PoC)
  - Targeted healthcare sector campaigns

3. PHI Exposure & Data Sensitivity
  - PHI-Critical: stores full patient records; escalated one level
  - PHI-Adjacent: closely tied to PHI workflows
  - PHI-Noncritical: no PHI but may affect continuity

4. Clinical Impact on Patient Care
  - Direct clinical systems (EHR, diagnostics, imaging)
  - Medical IoT devices
  - Operational systems (appointments, Wi-Fi, phones)

5. Exposure Surface & Accessibility
  - Internet-facing systems (highest priority)
  - Internal critical servers
  - Segmented internal systems
  - Isolated or legacy IoT devices

6. Business Context & Asset Criticality
  - Uptime requirements
  - Clinical schedule impact
  - Revenue and operational risk
  - Regulatory exposure

7. Feasibility of Remediation
  - Vendor restrictions
  - FDA constraints on medical devices
  - Legacy/unsupported operating systems
  - Use of compensating controls when patching is impossible

FINAL PRIORITY MATRIX
  - Critical+: CVSS Critical + KEV or PHI-Critical or severe clinical
    impact
  - Critical: CVSS Critical or active exploit + internet-exposed
  - High: CVSS High or PHI-Adjacent or medical device risk
  - Medium: CVSS Medium or internal workstation risk
  - Low: Low-risk misconfigurations with no PHI/ops impact

REMEDIATION SLAs
  - Critical+: 24 hours
  - Critical: 72 hours
  - High: 7 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: 90 days

-----------------------------------------------------------
8. REMEDIATION & MITIGATION PROCESS

MedLine uses a structured remediation workflow to ensure vulnerabilities
are corrected quickly, safely, and in compliance with HIPAA and internal
SLAs.
