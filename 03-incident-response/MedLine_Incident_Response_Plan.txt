MedLine Urgent Care
Incident Response Plan (IRP)
Version 1.0

1. PURPOSE

The purpose of this Incident Response Plan (IRP) is to define MedLine Urgent Care’s formal procedures for preparing for, detecting, analyzing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents. This plan ensures that all security events—including PHI breaches, ransomware attacks, unauthorized access, medical device compromise, and network intrusions—are handled in a consistent, timely, and HIPAA-compliant manner.

This IRP establishes the processes required to restore systems to normal operations, minimize patient care disruption, protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI, and ensure that MedLine learns from every incident to prevent recurrence. The goal is to safeguard clinical operations, maintain trust with patients, and reduce the likelihood and impact of future security incidents.


2. SCOPE

This Incident Response Plan applies to all MedLine Urgent Care workforce members—including employees, contractors, temporary staff, volunteers, and the outsourced IT support team—as well as all systems, networks, devices, and environments used to store, process, transmit, or access MedLine data.

The scope includes, but is not limited to:

- All clinical and administrative staff
- All IT, Security, Compliance, and Privacy personnel
- All vendors and third parties under Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)
- On-premise systems, workstations, laptops, and mobile devices
- EHR platforms, clinical applications, and supporting services
- Medical devices and IoT equipment integrated with MedLine’s network
- Network infrastructure including wired, wireless, and remote access solutions
- Cloud environments, SaaS applications, and hosted platforms
- Any system or asset containing or supporting Protected Health Information (PHI)
- Any system whose compromise may impact MedLine’s operations or patient safety

No user, system, or vendor with access to MedLine information is exempt from the requirements and responsibilities defined in this plan.


3. DEFINITIONS

Security Incident
Any attempted or actual unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of information; interference with system operations; or any event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of MedLine systems or PHI.

Breach
The impermissible acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of PHI that compromises its security or privacy, as defined under the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule.

PHI Breach
A breach specifically involving Protected Health Information (PHI) that triggers HIPAA reporting requirements, including patient notification and possible OCR (Office for Civil Rights) reporting.

Cybersecurity Event
Any observable occurrence in a system or network, which may indicate a security incident or require investigation.

Ransomware Attack
Malicious software that encrypts systems or data until a ransom is paid. A ransomware infection involving PHI is presumed to be a breach unless proven otherwise through documentation and forensic analysis.

Unauthorized Access
Access to MedLine systems or data—especially PHI—by an individual or system without valid permission or legitimate business need.

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
Artifacts such as malicious IP addresses, file hashes, registry changes, abnormal logins, or behavioral anomalies that suggest a system may be compromised.

Indicators of Attack (IOAs)
Behavioral clues or patterns (e.g., privilege escalation attempts, credential stuffing, mass file modifications) that signal malicious activity in progress.

Containment
Immediate actions taken to isolate an incident, limit its spread, prevent further damage, and protect unaffected systems.

Eradication
Permanent removal of the root cause of the incident, including deleting malware, disabling compromised accounts, patching exploited vulnerabilities, or correcting misconfigurations.

Recovery
Restoration of affected systems, applications, and data to normal operations in a secure manner, with validation steps to ensure residual risks are addressed.

Forensic Evidence
Digital artifacts—logs, memory captures, disk images, screenshots—collected and preserved to support investigation, root-cause analysis, or legal requirements.

Chain of Custody
A documented timeline showing the collection, handling, transfer, and storage of evidence to ensure integrity and admissibility.

Incident Response Team (IRT)
MedLine’s group responsible for coordinating and executing response actions during an incident. Includes Security, IT, Compliance, Privacy, Clinical Leads, and Executive Leadership as needed.

Severity Levels
Classification system used to determine the urgency of response actions:
- Low – Minimal impact
- Moderate – Limited operational or PHI exposure
- High – Significant disruption or high-risk PHI exposure
- Critical – Ransomware, confirmed PHI breach, major system compromise

Event Log
Recorded information about system activity used to detect, investigate, and verify incidents.

Compensating Controls
Security safeguards designed to reduce risk when primary controls fail or when immediate remediation is not possible.

Business Associate (BA)
A vendor or third party with access to PHI who must comply with HIPAA under a Business Associate Agreement (BAA).

Incident Ticket
A documented record of an incident in MedLine’s tracking system, containing timeline, actions taken, evidence, and final resolution.
