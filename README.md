# MedLine Healthcare Security Program (Portfolio Project)

This repository contains a full, end-to-end cybersecurity and GRC program built for a fictional urgent care clinic ("MedLine").  
Goal: demonstrate healthcare security design thinking across threat modeling, HIPAA-aligned risk assessment, incident response, vulnerability management, and policy.

## Contents
- Threat Modeling (STRIDE + attack paths): /02-threat-modeling
- Risk Assessment (HIPAA-oriented): /01-risk-assessment
- Incident Response Plan + simulations: /03-incident-response
- Vulnerability Management Workflow: /04-vulnerability-management
- Full Policy Suite: /05-policy-suite

## Frameworks & Standards Referenced
- HIPAA Security Rule (administrative, physical, technical safeguards)
- NIST 800-61 (Incident Response lifecycle)
- STRIDE (threat modeling)
- CVSS v3.1 (vulnerability severity)

## Notes
- This is a fictional environment. No real patient data (PHI) is used.
- Documents are written in an audit-ready style for portfolio purposes.
